## Who am I?
My name is Joel Cooper and I am a Canadian-born, Marine Corps veteran living in Texas. I have lived in Texas for
over 17 years. I was stationed on Parris Island, South Carolina, for four years. I love retro-style 80's remixes and
I especially love Miami Vice.

### What is the "Growth Mindset"?
**The growth mindset can be summed up with the following:**
- A positive outlook on all upcoming work and obstacles.
- Anyone can have this mindset. It will set you up for success when it comes to tackling new challenges.
- Learning from mistakes, persisting through hard work, and accepting criticism are all key concepts when it comes to the growth mindset.
