## Who am I?
My name is Joel Cooper and I am a Canadian-born, Marine Corps veteran living in Texas. I have lived in Texas for
over 17 years. I was stationed on Parris Island, South Carolina, for four years. I love retro-style 80's remixes and
I especially love Miami Vice.

Why do I like Miami Vice so much?

### What is the "Growth Mindset"?
**The growth mindset can be summed up with the following:**
1. A positive outlook on all upcoming work and obstacles.
2. Anyone can have this mindset. It will set you up for success when it comes to tackling new challenges.
3. Learning from mistakes, persisting through hard work, and accepting criticism are all key concepts when it comes to the growth mindset.
