## Paths: Absolute and Relative.

-Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory; These begin with a forward slash.
-Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system; these do not have a slash.

## Files

-Everything is a file from a text file, a directory, a keyboard, a monitor, etc.

-Files can be hidden for different reasons such as not getting in the way of the user.
