-The write() method of the document object allows new content to be written into the page where the script element sits.
-When the browswer comes accross a script element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.

## Statements

-A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end in a semicolon.
-Statements are instructions and each one starts on a new line.
-Statements can be organized into code blocks; Code blocks are the curly braces.
